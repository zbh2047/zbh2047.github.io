* Besides research, I enjoy music very much (especially piano), and I am eager to learn music theory and music arrangement of chord.
* Several of my favorite computer games are: [BABA Is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/), [Patrick's Parabox](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260520/Patricks_Parabox/), Minecraft, Portal, and OuterWilds.
* During my undergraduate, I wrote some interesting projects including a game and a compression software. I just put it below to commemorate my college time.
* [Here](https://www.cnblogs.com/zbh2047/) is my previous personal blog, containing some of my training and experience in the ACM ICPC programming competition.

Some High-school and Undergraduate Projects
======

- **Electricity and Magnetismm**: a computer game made in 2014. [\[Download here\]](/files/Electricity and magnetismm.7z)\\
  It is an interesting puzzle game programmed in C++ language on Windows platform. It contains dozens of levels with increasing difficulties (many of them created by myself), and a custom map editor to create new levels.
- **ZCF**: A new compression software made in 2016. [\[Download here\]](/files/ZCF.zip)\\
  I designed my own compression algorithm based on [suffix automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_automaton), dynamic programming, and [huffman tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding). This creates a compression software with very high compression rate (better than [zip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)) format and approaching [rar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR_(file_format)) format), while being efficient for both compression and decompression. I really enjoy this project since it combines a lot of algorithms learned in the ACM ICPC competition.
- **New Tetris**: a computer game made in 2013. [\[Download here\]](/files/new tetris.zip)\\
  It is a game programmed in C language on Windows platform. This is the first game I have written myself when I studied the C language.
- **Gomoku**: made in 2016. [Download here](/files/Gomoku.zip)\\
  Programmed in C# language on Windows platform.
