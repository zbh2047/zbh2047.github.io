* Besides research, I enjoy music very much (especially piano), and I am eager to learn music theory and music arrangement of chord.
* Several of my favorite computer games are: [BABA Is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/), [Patrick's Parabox](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260520/Patricks_Parabox/), Minecraft, Portal, and OuterWilds.
* During my undergraduate, I wrote some interesting projects including a game and a compression software. I just put it below to commemorate my college time.
* [Here](https://www.cnblogs.com/zbh2047/) is my previous personal blog, containing some of my training and experience in the ACM ICPC programming competition.
