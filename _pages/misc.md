Personal Interest
======
<img align="right" src="/files/baba.jfif" alt="Photo" style="width: 96px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 8px 8px 8px 8px"/>
* Besides research, I enjoy music very much (especially piano), and I am eager to learn music theory and music arrangement of chord.
* Several of my favorite computer games are: BABA Is You, Minecraft, Portal, and OuterWilds.
* During my undergraduate, I wrote some interesting project including a game and a compression software. I just put it below to commemorate my college time.
* [Here](https://www.cnblogs.com/zbh2047/) is my previous personal blog, containing some of my training and experience in the ACM ICPC programming competition.

Some Undergraduate Projects
