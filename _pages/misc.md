Personal Interest
======
* Besides research, I enjoy music very much (especially piano), and I am eager to learn music theory and music arrangement of chord.
* During my undergraduate, I write some interesting project including a game and a compression software. I just put it below to commemorate my college time.
* [Here](https://www.cnblogs.com/zbh2047/) is my previous personal blog, containing some of my training and experience in the ACM ICPC programming competition.

Some Undergraduate Projects
